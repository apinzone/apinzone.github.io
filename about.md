# About Me

Iâ€™m Anthony Pinzone, a data scientist, applied exercise physiologist, and university lecturer with a deep-rooted passion for uncovering the physiological and behavioral mechanisms behind human performance.

My academic journey began at Hofstra University, where I earned both my Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s degrees in Exercise Science. It was during this time that I developed a strong foundation in human physiology, biomechanics, and research methodologyâ€”skills that would become central to my future work.

I later pursued my Ph.D. in Exercise Physiology at Kent State University, where my research focused on athlete fatigue, game scheduling, and performance analytics in professional sports. My doctoral dissertation introduced the Relative Rest Index (RRI), a novel metric designed to quantify rest disparities and model their influence on game outcomes in the NBA and NFL. This work combined traditional physiological insight with advanced statistical modeling techniques, including hierarchical linear modeling and multilevel regression.

Today, I serve as a Lecturer in the Department of Kinesiology at California State University San Marcos, where I teach courses in exercise physiology, research methods, and special populations. I also teach part-time at San Diego State University and at the Emeritus Institute at Saddleback College. Iâ€™m deeply passionate about the research process and remain actively involved in multiple projects. Currently, my primary focus is on modeling the relationship between athlete recovery and team performance across multiple professional sports, with an emphasis on data-driven methods to enhance performance outcomes.

In addition to my academic roles, I consult on applied sports science projects and am currently expanding my expertise in machine learning, predictive analytics, and Python-based modeling. Whether in the lab or the classroom, my mission remains the same: to bridge the gap between theory and practice, and to translate data into actionable insight that enhances performance, well-being, and decision-making.
