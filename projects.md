## Selected Publications

**Relative Rest Index Influences Team Performance and Game Outcomes in Recent NBA Competition**  
_Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, In Review, 2025_  
➤ Employed a multilevel modeling approach to assess game-to-game influence of RRI on team performance during the 2022–23 through 2023–24 NBA regular seasons.

**The Relationship Between Relative Rest Index and Team Performance Across Competitive NFL Seasons**  
_Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, 39(8):875-879, 2025_. [DOI](10.1519/JSC.0000000000005148)  
➤ Assessed the influence of RRI on win percentage during all NFL seasons dating back to 1970.

**Relative Rest Index Correlates to Winning Percentage in 2022 National Football League Season: A Preliminary Study**  
_International Journal of Strength and Conditioning, 5(1), 2025_. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.47206/ijsc.v5i1.403)    
➤ Developed a novel metric (RRI) to quantify rest mismatches and asess their influence on win percentage in recent NFL competition.  

**Hemodynamic and Autonomic Modulation in Response to Additive Sympathetic Stressors in Young, Healthy Individuals**  
_International Journal of Exercise Science, In Review, 2025_.  
➤ Assessed autonomic reactivity in response to physiological stress and resistance exercise in a healthy, resistance-trained population. 

## Applied Work
**Sports Performance Modeling**  
  ➤Exploring use of game footage and player-level data to predict player and team fatigue with machine learning classifiers (Python, R)

**Open-Source HRV Program**  
➤ Development of a peak detection Python algorithm to precisely calculate time- and frequency-domain HRV from raw ECG signals as well as baroreflex sensitivity from comparison of RRI time series and corresponding time series of PPG-derived blood pressure waves.  
➤ Future goals: Full release as a valid signal processing research tool (*Validation study currently in progress*).  
➤ Check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/apinzone/OS_HRV/)!

**Science Communication: Healthspan**  
  ➤Synthesizing peer-reviewed scientific evidence for key physiological concepts in wellness, aging, and exercise science for a wellness-savvy audience.  
  ➤ [Article](https://gethealthspan.com/science/article/hrv-and-oxytocin): *Understanding HRV as a Real-Time Marker of Neural Responsiveness. How Does Oxytocin Change the Signal?*
