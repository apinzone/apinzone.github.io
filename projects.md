## Selected Publications

**Relative Rest Index Influences Team Performance in Recent NBA Competition**  
_Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, In Review, 2025_  
➤ Employed a multilevel modeling approach to assess game-to-game influence of RRI on team performance during the 2022–23 through 2023–24 NBA regular seasons.

**The Relationship Between Relative Rest Index and Team Performance Across Competitive NFL Seasons**  
_Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, In Press, 2025_  
➤ Assessed the influence of RRI on win percentage during all NFL seasons dating back to 1970.

**Relative Rest Index Correlates to Winning Percentage in 2022 National Football League Season: A Preliminary Study**  
_International Journal of Strength and Conditioning, 5(1), 2025_  
➤ Developed a novel metric (RRI) to quantify rest mismatches and model their influence on game outcomes using multilevel regression.

## Applied Work
**Sports Performance Modeling**  
  ➤Exploring use of game footage and player-level data to predict player and team fatigue with machine learning classifiers (Python, R)

**Open-Source HRV Program**  
➤ Development of a peak detection Python algorithm to precisely calculate time-domain HRV from raw ECG signals  
➤ Future goals:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ Add frequency domain measures of HRV<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ Add sequencing-method derived baroreflex sensitivity calculations<br>
